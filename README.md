Main idea: using Python to create software and website that people can upload random documents to generate accessible PDF compatible with text-to-speech software

we have to have python to break the document down so chatGPT can generate the alt text and then tagging is an issue. 

one of the famous text-to-speech is Natural Reader at https://www.naturalreaders.com/ 

Web versions should be max to 30 pages and app can be unlimited
